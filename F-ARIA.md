# First rule of ARIA
Use semantic HTML5!
Example: Hamburger menu (proper)
```htmlaria-expanded
<button id="menu">Menu</button>
```
See Codepen for examples of _aria-expanded_

_Aria-live_ for announcing new content on page (such as dynamic content, i.e. search results) (polite, assertive)

Wp.a11y.speak()

_Aria-label_

_aria-describedby_ (used on input to read P with id for information)

_aria-labelledby_ (replaces form input label text)
