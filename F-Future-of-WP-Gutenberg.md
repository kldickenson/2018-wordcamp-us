Everything is an iteration influenced by both internal and external influences

## WP Functionality that has progressed
* Post Formats
* Embeds
* Front End Editing
* Shortcake (shortcodes -> prototype of Blocks)
* zeditor (post rich-text editor, block based, maintaining back compatibility)
* Calypso Editor (Classic Editor -> blobs of HTML)
* Gutenberg (current conclusion of this progress)

XML-RPC -> REST API

## Design Practices
