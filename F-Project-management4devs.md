## Scope Creep

_Projects have a beginning and an end, and they have a defined scope and resources to complete_

Project Management Triangle - Triple Constraint 
Goal: keep the triangle equal lateral

Scope    Time

90% of project management is communication!

Need to get input from _BOTH_ the decision makers and the stakeholder.
