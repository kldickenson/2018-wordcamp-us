# What's Privacy Got to Do with IT? - Kevin Koehler, Leo Postovoit


## What is required?

### Universal Principles (the basics)
* Be transparent about the data you collect, and why.
* Get only the data you need.
* Don't store the data any longer than necessary.
* Keep the data safe.
* Be accountable to your users (and regulators).
* Write it all down (both internal and external document).

Privacy is a process. You have to continuously maintain it.

A strong privacy framework can strengthen your client relationships, arm you to ship better products, reduce legal liability, with ethics...

Privacy by design.
