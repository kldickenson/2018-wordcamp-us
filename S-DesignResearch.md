A good question is more powerful than a good answer.

Forever learning.

"Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position, but certainty is an absurd one. " - Voltaire

Asking questions is uncomfortable

There is _NO_ ROI in customer centered design.

A design project is a series of decisions.
Research leads to _evidence-based_ decisions.
Collaboration means working together towards a _shared_ goal.
Bad incentives by rewarding individual contribution over group. (Negative)
Competition for internal resources. (Negative)
Academic research is not (traditionally) collaborative.

Well informed decision making.

"Designing Together" by Dan M. Brown

## Objections to doing research:
We don't have time
We don't have money
We don't have expertise!
We have specialists (hiding out in another building)
Let's make a prototype.

## Advantages:
Faster decisions
Lower risk
Continuing Returns
Everyone is more efficient
Everyone working from a common view with a _shared reality_

Everyone wants better products, faster

No one wants to read reports. 

Make sure you are _goal driven_ and have a _skeptical mindset._

Insights -> Decisions -> Success

Set Goal -> Form Questions -> 

Research question != interview question

You need both descriptions and measurements

It's easy to mistake the polish of a prototype for the ....

Share knowledge!

Analyze by talking it through!

Goal -> Idea -> Design -> Assessment -> Goal -> ...
