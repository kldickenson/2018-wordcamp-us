## GOAL
Establish a structured mandatory code review process to enforce consistency, improve code quality, and promote learning, knowledge sharing, and collaboration.

    Everything must be accompanied by tests.
    Use standardized GIT process.    
    Continuous integration (Travis)
    Grunt

    Pull request templates
    Accessibility analysis (Pa11y)

## Training

## Learned:
    Limit PR Scope
    Include a URL to Test
    Avoid LGTM (Looks good to me)!
    Make suggestions, leave corrections to be done by the original coder (learning moment)
    Delete Branches after merging, always start from a new branch
    Good Branch Naming (per pre-determined naming conventions)
    PR responsibility
    Set "Stalemate Rules"
    Code review etiquette (encourage positive language and tone)
    Review only the code, not the person, avoid "you" -> "we"
    Everyone makes mistakes, support each other

## Engagement

## Success criteria:
Everyone must buy in.
Clearly set expectations
